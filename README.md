# Synopsis
This Haskell package provides matrix types and operations in pure Haskell,
with a clean interface and the minimal dependencies `base` and `array`.

# Currently included features
* Matrix multiplication
* Reduction to row echelon form

# Name origin
This library was inspired by the [`bed-and-breakfast`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bed-and-breakfast)
package. In lack of a better name, ... well, i guess it's obvious how it happened. :wink:

(Don't ask me about `bed-and-breakfast`'s name origin, though.)
